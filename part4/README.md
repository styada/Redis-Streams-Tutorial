# Part 4: Attaching Streams to Agent Tasks for Detailed Logging

We're almost there! Now that we have tasks with streams, let's make it all about agents. This part focuses on logging the rich details of what your AI agents are doing during background tasks.

## The Background: Why Detailed Agent Logging Matters

In your work scenario, agents aren't just processing tasks—they're thinking, using tools, and making decisions. To stream meaningful updates to users, we need to log:

- **Chain of thought**: The agent's reasoning process
- **Tool usage**: Which tools it calls and their results
- **Progress updates**: Step-by-step status
- **Errors**: Any issues that arise

Without this, users just see "processing..." with no insight. With streams, we can provide a live narrative of the agent's work.

## Walkthrough: Enhancing the Consumer for Agents

Building on Part 3's consumer, we now simulate an agent that:

1. **Analyzes the task** and logs its initial thoughts
2. **Calls a mock LLM** for reasoning (we'll stub this out as requested)
3. **Uses tools** and logs each action
4. **Updates progress** throughout
5. **Completes or errors** with final status

Each log entry goes to the task's stream with timestamps and structured data. For example:

- `{'event': 'chain_of_thought', 'step': 'analyzing_task', 'prompt': 'Process this data...'}`
- `{'event': 'tool_usage', 'tool': 'data_processor', 'action': 'load_file'}`

Run `agent_consumer.py` (after adding tasks with the producer from Part 3). It processes tasks and fills their streams with detailed logs.

## Key Features for Your Agent System

- **Mocked LLM**: Instead of real API calls, we use fake responses to simulate reasoning
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format makes it easy to parse and display
- **Real-time**: Logs appear instantly in the stream
- **Per-Task Isolation**: Each agent's work is cleanly separated

## How This Sets Up the Finale

With rich agent logs flowing into streams, Part 5 will show how to read those streams and stream the updates back to users. Imagine a web dashboard where users see the agent's thought process unfold in real-time!

This is the heart of your system—transparent, logged, and streamable agent work.
