# Part 1: Introduction to Redis Streams

Redis Streams is a data structure introduced in Redis 5.0 that allows you to store and manage streams of data. It's designed for high-performance, append-only logs that can be consumed by multiple consumers.

## Key Concepts

- **Stream**: An append-only log of entries, each with a unique ID.
- **Entry**: A key-value pair added to the stream.
- **Consumer Group**: A way to distribute messages among multiple consumers.
- **Consumer**: An entity that reads from the stream.

## Basic Operations

- `XADD`: Add an entry to a stream
- `XRANGE`: Read entries from a stream within a range
- `XREAD`: Read entries from one or more streams
- `XGROUP`: Manage consumer groups
- `XREADGROUP`: Read entries as part of a consumer group

## Use Cases

- Event sourcing
- Message queues
- Real-time analytics
- Activity logging

In this tutorial, we'll use Redis Streams to log agent activities and stream responses back to users.
