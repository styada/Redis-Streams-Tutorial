# Part 3: Integrating Redis Streams with Your Task Queue

Alright, we're getting to the meaty part! So far, we've learned about streams and set up our Redis environment. Now, let's combine them with task management—the core of your agent system.

## The Background: Why Combine Queues and Streams?

Your current agent setup probably uses Redis for queuing tasks (like processing data or sending emails). But to add real-time logging and streaming, we need to attach a stream to each task. This way, as the agent works, it can log its progress, and users can watch it unfold live.

Think of it like this: The queue manages "what to do," and streams manage "what's happening while doing it."

## Walkthrough: Building the Integration

We'll use Redis lists for the task queue—it's simple and reliable:

- `LPUSH`: Add a task to the front of the queue
- `BRPOP`: Block and wait for a task, removing it from the end (FIFO)

But here's the key addition: Each task gets its own stream for logging. The stream name includes the task ID, like `task_logs:123`.

### The Flow in Action

1. **Producer** (your app or user) adds tasks to the queue using `producer.py`
2. **Consumer** (your agent worker) picks up a task with `BRPOP`
3. Consumer creates a unique stream for that task
4. As it processes, it logs events to the stream (started, processing steps, completed)
5. The stream acts as a real-time log that other parts of your system can read

Run `producer.py` first to add some tasks, then `consumer.py` to process them. Watch how each task gets its own stream with logs.

## Why This Architecture Works for Agents

- **Scalability**: Multiple consumers can process tasks in parallel
- **Observability**: Each task's stream gives you a complete audit trail
- **Real-time**: Streams allow instant logging without database overhead
- **Isolation**: Per-task streams prevent logs from mixing up

## How This Flows to the Next Parts

This part connects the dots between queuing and logging. In Part 4, we'll make it agent-specific: logging chain of thought, tool usage, and mocking LLM responses. Then in Part 5, we'll stream those logs back to users in real-time.

You're building a powerful monitoring system for your agents—keep going!
