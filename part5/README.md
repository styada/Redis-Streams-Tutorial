# Part 5: Streaming Agent Responses Back to Users

Congratulations! We've reached the finale. All the pieces come together here as we stream the agent's logged activities back to users in real-time. This is the payoff for your work scenario.

## The Background: Why Stream to Users?

Your users submit tasks to agents and wait for results. Instead of a static "processing..." message, they can now see a live feed of what the agent is doing. It's like watching a sports game with play-by-play commentary, but for AI work.

This builds trust, provides transparency, and lets users intervene if needed. Plus, it's just cool to see the agent's "thinking" unfold.

## Walkthrough: Reading and Streaming Logs

We use `XREAD` to continuously read new entries from a task's stream. The `stream_reader.py` script:

1. Takes a task ID as input
2. Connects to the corresponding stream (e.g., `agent_logs:123`)
3. Reads new entries in a loop, blocking until new data arrives
4. Prints each log entry with timestamp and details
5. Stops when the task completes

In a real app, this would push updates to a web socket or UI component instead of printing to console.

## How It All Flows Together

Let's trace a complete journey:

1. **User submits task** → Producer adds to queue
2. **Agent picks up task** → Creates stream, starts logging (Parts 3-4)
3. **Agent processes** → Logs chain of thought, tool usage, progress
4. **User watches live** → Stream reader displays updates in real-time (this part)
5. **Task completes** → User sees final results

The streams act as the communication channel between background agents and foreground users.

## Wrapping It Up

You've now built a complete system for agent task management with Redis Streams:

- **Queues** for task distribution
- **Streams** for real-time logging
- **Consumers** for processing
- **Readers** for streaming to users

This scales well, handles multiple agents/users, and provides the transparency you need. Experiment with the scripts, tweak them for your needs, and integrate into your work project. You've got this!
